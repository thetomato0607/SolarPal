## The Concept

If you simply program a battery to "buy low and sell high," you risk overloading the local transformer.

This project bridges the gap between **Quantitative Finance** and **Power Systems Engineering**. It is a Bloomberg-style trading dashboard that uses **Linear Programming (LP)** to optimize residential battery schedules against volatile UK electricity prices, while strictly enforcing DNO G99 grid constraints.

**The result?** A trading strategy that maximizes arbitrage revenue without ever violating physical voltage limits.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/thetomato0607/SolarPal.git](https://github.com/thetomato0607/SolarPal.git)
cd SolarPal
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Run the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Opens at:** `http://localhost:8501`

## The Engineering Logic

### The Conflict: Profit vs. Physics
A naive algorithm sees a high price at 6 PM and discharges 5kW of power. But if the household solar is also generating, the total export might hit 7kW.
- Result: Voltage rise > 10%, potential equipment damage, and heavy fines.
#### The Solution: Linear Programming
I formulated the problem not as a set of heuristics (if/else rules), but as a constrained optimization problem. The solver finds the global optimum that satisfies all physical constraints simultaneously.
- Objective: Maximize Revenue = Sum(Grid_Export * Price * dt)

- Subject to hard constraints:
Capacity: Battery cannot be empty or overcharged (0% <= SoC <= 100%).
Power: Inverter cannot exceed rating (+/- 5kW).
The "Golden Rule": Net_Export <= 4.0 kW.

Because this is a convex problem, the solver guarantees mathematical compliance with the grid limit while extracting the maximum possible profit.

### 2. **Grid Engine** (Physical Constraints)
- DNO G99 compliance checking
- Voltage rise calculation (±10% limit)
- Transformer thermal limits
- Automatic violation detection

### 3. **Interactive Dashboard**
- Dark-mode Bloomberg-style UI
- Real-time optimization (< 0.5s solve time)
- Configurable scenarios (volatility, cloud cover)
- Professional Plotly visualizations

## How It Works

### The Optimization Problem

```
Objective:
    Maximize Σ(Grid_Export × Price × dt)

Subject to:
    1. Battery capacity: 0 <= SoC <= 13.5 kWh
    2. Power limits: |Charge|, |Discharge| <= 5 kW
    3. Grid limit: Net_Export <= 4.0 kW  ← THE KEY CONSTRAINT
    4. Energy conservation: SoC dynamics with 90% efficiency
```

**Solver:** SciPy's HiGHS (interior-point Linear Programming)

### Why This Matters

Without optimization, a battery might discharge at high prices while solar is generating, exceeding the grid export limit:

```
Naive Strategy:
Solar: 3 kW
Battery discharge: 5 kW
→ Net export: 8 kW (exceeds 4 kW limit!)
→ Transformer overload, voltage rise > 10%, £20k DNO fine

LP-Constrained:
Optimizer automatically curtails discharge to 1 kW
→ Net export: 4 kW (exactly at limit)
→ Revenue loss: £1.20 | Penalty avoided: £20k+
```

The grid constraint is **mathematically guaranteed** by the LP solver.

## Important Notes

### Grid Constraints:
The 4 kW export limit represents typical UK DNO G99 connection limits. Exceeding this causes:
- Voltage rise > ±10% (statutory limit)
- Transformer thermal overload
- Protection relay trips
- £20k+ DNO penalties

### Optimization Method:
We use Linear Programming (not heuristics) because:
- **Provable optimality:** Guarantees best solution
- **Constraint enforcement:** Mathematically ensures grid limit satisfaction
- **Fast:** Solves in real-time (<0.5s)
- **Explainable:** Can justify decisions to regulators

### For Recruiters:
This project demonstrates:
- Quantitative optimization (LP formulation)
- Domain expertise (UK energy markets, G99 regs)
- System design (modular architecture)
- Production thinking (fast solvers, API-ready)
- Communication (professional documentation)

**Key Talking Point:** *"The grid constraint is enforced as an LP inequality, guaranteeing compliance without manual checks—this is production-grade DNO integration."*
