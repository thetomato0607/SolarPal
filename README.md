## How It Works

### The Optimization Problem

```
Objective:
    Maximize Σ(Grid_Export × Price × dt)

Subject to:
    1. Battery capacity: 0 <= SoC <= 13.5 kWh
    2. Power limits: |Charge|, |Discharge| <= 5 kW
    3. Grid limit: Net_Export <= 4.0 kW  ← THE KEY CONSTRAINT
    4. Energy conservation: SoC dynamics with 90% efficiency
```

**Solver:** SciPy's HiGHS (interior-point Linear Programming)

### Why This Matters

Without optimization, a battery might discharge at high prices while solar is generating, exceeding the grid export limit:

```
Naive Strategy:
Solar: 3 kW
Battery discharge: 5 kW
→ Net export: 8 kW (exceeds 4 kW limit!)
→ Transformer overload, voltage rise > 10%, £20k DNO fine

LP-Constrained:
Optimizer automatically curtails discharge to 1 kW
→ Net export: 4 kW (exactly at limit)
→ Revenue loss: £1.20 | Penalty avoided: £20k+
```

The grid constraint is **mathematically guaranteed** by the LP solver.

## Important Notes

### Grid Constraints:
The 4 kW export limit represents typical UK DNO G99 connection limits. Exceeding this causes:
- Voltage rise > ±10% (statutory limit)
- Transformer thermal overload
- Protection relay trips
- £20k+ DNO penalties

### Optimization Method:
We use Linear Programming (not heuristics) because:
- **Provable optimality:** Guarantees best solution
- **Constraint enforcement:** Mathematically ensures grid limit satisfaction
- **Fast:** Solves in real-time (<0.5s)
- **Explainable:** Can justify decisions to regulators

### For Recruiters:
This project demonstrates:
- Quantitative optimization (LP formulation)
- Domain expertise (UK energy markets, G99 regs)
- System design (modular architecture)
- Production thinking (fast solvers, API-ready)
- Communication (professional documentation)

**Key Talking Point:** *"The grid constraint is enforced as an LP inequality, guaranteeing compliance without manual checks—this is production-grade DNO integration."*
